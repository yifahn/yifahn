- 👋 Hi, I’m Yifahn
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming, Gaming & Music
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ReactJS, JavaScript & cloud technologies
- 💞️ My favourite language currently is C#, as I am working on my own game within Unity3D, which will be exported as a WebGL application, connected to and housed inside a React.JS website @ yifahn.com
- 📫 You can contact me by emailing yifahn@gmail.com

My personal goals are to finish this gosh darn website and game so I can publish them and use them instead of a CV, as a CV, as CV's are too hard for my tiny little brain and they make me angry.
If you like my shit and wanna use any of it, no worries, however if you're going to use my shit for commercial purposes, ask for permission first at yifahn@gmail.com.

Thank you.
